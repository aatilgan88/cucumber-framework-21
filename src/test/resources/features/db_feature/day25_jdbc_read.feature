    Given user connects to the database
    # column=Price     table name = HOTELROOM
    # NOTE : column and table name must be accurate
    # SCHEMA has all information about the database. So we use SCHEMA  to write the correct names

    And user gets "Price" from "tHOTELROOM" table

#    And user gets "Name" from "tHOTEL" table
#
#    And user gets "Price" from "HOTEL" table
#
#    And user gets "Notes" from "tHOTELROOMRESERVATION" table

  And user reads all rows in the "Price" column
#    And user reads all rows in the "Name" column
#    And user reads all rows in the "Notes" column

    # CREATE A NEW STEPDEFINITION TO DO ASSERTION FOR THIS LINE
    And users gets the value in row 5 in "Price" column and verifies the value is "470.0000"
